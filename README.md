# ABOUT-ME


Hello! I'm a full-stack web developer with a passion that began when I was a teengager. However, it wasn't until I embarked on a self-discovery journey upon moving to Mexico that enabled me to invest the time to learn. Finally, in my 30s, I was able to immerse myself in learning HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, React, NextJS, and TypeScript. Currently, I'm focused on a pet sitting app project aimed at streamlining pet care services in Mexico.

I've had the pleasure of working on impactful projects in the past, including building free websites for local businesses like a massage therapist's practice and a salon. It's been rewarding to leverage technology to support small businesses in my community.

I'm always eager to expand my skills and contribute to the tech industry's growth, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead!
